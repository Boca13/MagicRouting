 * This application is used to test the basic functionality of the printf service.  
 * It is initiated by calling the start() command of the SplitControl interface 
 * provided by the PrintfC component.  After starting the printf service, calls to 
 * the standard c-style printf command are made to print various strings of text 
 * over the serial line.  Only upon calling PrintfFlush.flush() does the data 
 * actually get sent out over the serial line.
